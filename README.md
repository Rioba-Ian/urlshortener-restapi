# URL Shortener API

This project is a URL shortener API built with Fastify, TypeScript, and Prisma. It provides a service that takes long URLs and generates shorter, more manageable URLs.

## Technologies Used

- Fastify: A web framework for Node.js known for its high performance and low overhead.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language.
- Prisma: A database toolkit used for database operations.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/shorturl`: Creates a new short URL.

  - Request body should be a JSON object with a `destination` property containing the URL to shorten.
  - Returns a JSON object with the short URL.

- `GET /api/shorturl/:shortId`: Redirects to the original URL associated with the given `shortId`.
  - `shortId` should be replaced with the ID of the short URL.
  - Increments the count in the analytics for the URL.

## How to Consume the API

You can consume the API using any HTTP client like `fetch` in JavaScript, `requests` in Python, or tools like Postman. Here's an example using `fetch`:

```js
// Create a new short URL
fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/shorturl", {
 method: "POST",
 headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
 body: JSON.stringify({destination: "https://example.com"}),
})
 .then((response) => response.json())
 .then((data) => console.log(data));
```
